*C Unit Testing Framework*

Welcome to **c'est la vie** (abbreviated as `CLV`), a unit testing framework for C.

This framework is made to emphasize the importance of unit testing to beginner programmers who are using C. I personally believe learning how to perform *test-driven* development is an invaluable skill as a programmer, and hence this framework was created.

This framework adopts a *plug-and-play* mindset when it comes to testing, believing that it should not require a lot of effort to begin writing tests. CLV aims to kickstart the testing process, so that you can immediately get back to producing more and *safer* code.
